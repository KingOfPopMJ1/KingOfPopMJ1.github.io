  <h1>Warrawee</h1>
  <p>Warrawee is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Warrawee is
    located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District, in the local government area of
    Ku-ring-gai Council.[2] Warrawee is predominantly a residential suburb with few commercial entities. Notably, its
    railway station supports no commercial activities, which is uncommon on the Sydney train network. The closest thing
    to commercial activity is Knox Grammar School, which is no more than 200 metres from the station, although it is
    officially located in Wahroonga, it is located predominantly in Warrawee, and sits on the boundary of the two
    suburbs[3]

    The suburb should not be confused with Wirrawee, the fictional small country town in the Tomorrow series of books
    for young people by John Marsden, or the film derived from the first book, Tomorrow, When the War Began (2010).

    The name Warrawee is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning rest a while, stop here or to stand.[4]

    The suburb has a notable architectural history, with a number of houses designed by prominent architects. The
    earliest significant homes were Pibrac (1888), Cheddington (1890) and Wirepe (1893).

    In 1888, the public servant and patron of exploration, Frederick Eccleston Du Faur, built his house Pibrac in Pibrac
    Avenue. The house was designed by John Horbury Hunt, a Canadian architect who settled in Australia and favoured the
    Arts and Crafts style, as well as the North American Shingle style, which he introduced to Australia. Later
    alterations were carried out by B.J. Waterhouse. The house is built predominantly of timber, with extensive use of
    timber shingles, on a sandstone base. It is considered a good example of Hunt's work and is listed on the Register
    of the National Estate.[5]

    Cheddington, the oldest home in established Hastings Road, is also attributed to Horbury Hunt, constructed in brick,
    with a slate roof and characteristic shingling. Wirepe, designed by M.B. Halligan for architect Walter Traill, uses
    deep verandahs and high ceilings to elicit a homestead atmosphere, with fine corbelled chimneys and cedar shingles.
    The brickwork is laid in colonial bond, and the house sits at the heart of the Ku-ring-gai heritage precinct on
    Hastings Road.

    Upton Grey (now Kooyong) was built in 1894 to a John Sulman design, and its English features are a local landmark.
    Across the century it has served as a government social services home, a CSIRO field station, and a boarding house
    for Knox Grammar School. It is now in private hands and retains features replicated at Sulman's important
    Ingleholme.

    Exley House, in Finlay Road, Warrawee, was designed by Harry Seidler in 1957 for Cecil Exley, an engineer with the
    Sydney Water Board, and his wife. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home is the only red-brick single-storey dwelling
    Harry Seidler designed. It has recently been sympathetically extended.

    As with all North Shore suburbs with Aboriginal names, Warrawee was the name of a railway station which was then
    attached to the surrounding suburb.[6] Warrawee developed in the early 20th century as an exclusive residential
    district, with no shops, offices, post office, public school, churches or through roads.[7] In 1923, Knox Grammar
    School was founded at Earlston, a Warrawee property across the railway line. All blocks were kept to between 1 and 4
    acres (0.4 and 1.6 hectares), and the form of houses was tightly controlled.[7][8] Joseph Beresford Grant used his
    money to guarantee the exclusiveness of the development, and also ensured that there were no shops around the
    area.[7][9]

    Transport
    Further information: Public transport in Sydney
    The Pacific Highway is the main arterial road. Warrawee railway station is on the North Shore railway line on the
    Sydney Trains network. The railway station built in 1900 was the last one built on the North Shore Line before it
    was extended to North Sydney. Local residents had to fight the railway commissioners for a railway station, that is
    only one kilometre from Wahroonga.

    At the 2021 census, 3.7% of employed people travelled to work on public transport compared to 4.6% average for all
    of Australia, while 25.5% travelled by car (either as driver or as passenger) compared to 57.8% nationally.

    CDC NSW operates one bus route through the suburb of Warrawee:

    573: Turramurra to Sydney Adventist Hospital[10]

    on the Pacific Highway.[11] According to the school's website, it was established in 1906.[12]

    Knox Grammar School is predominately in the suburb of Warrawee, and sits no more than 200m from Warrawee railway
    station. The school lists its address as Wahroonga since the Administration Office is situated within that
    suburb.[13]
